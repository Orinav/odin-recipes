        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A recipe for homemade pizza <strong>dough</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 cups (360 ml) warm water</li>
                <li>2 tsp instant or active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3.5 cups (420 g) all-purpose or bread flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
                <li>2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Activate the Yeast: In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Stir gently and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. The mixture should become foamy and bubbly, which indicates the yeast is active.</li>
                <li>Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li>
                <li>Mix Dough: Gradually add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon or a stand mixer with a dough hook. Once the dough comes together, add the olive oil.</li>
                <li>Knead: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead by hand for 8-10 minutes, or with a stand mixer for 6-8 minutes, until the dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky.</li>
                <li>First Rise: Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Divide Dough: Once risen, punch the dough down to release the air. Turn it out onto a floured surface and divide it into two equal balls.</li>
            </ol>
